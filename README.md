This project was to explain to beginners what a "bento" is and an image gallery of what they can look like. On the PC, when the user hovers their mouse cursor over the cute "bowl" image, it should go opaque. Due to the nature of touch-screens, that function doesn't come for mobile users (tablet/mobile). By clicking the bowl it sends the user to the image gallery.
The gallery itself was to be a lightbox.

The lightbox was not finished.
