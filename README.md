This Project is a simple 3x3 Match game. All of the coding that is present has been what I learned through the Treehouse courses with the exception of the Match Game itself. The match game code is a tutorial I found at https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-build-a-memory-matching-game-in-javascript . While I edited the code to make sure it worked, one code that I took due to the recommendation of the tutorial was the "Fisher-Yates Shuffle". In my Javascript file, I will have commented that code to credit them.
